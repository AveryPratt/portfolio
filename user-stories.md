User Stories

As an employer, I want the site to showcase the developer's talents and experience. I want the site to show me the most important information first, such as projects worked on, followed by past experience and education, and last of all contact information.

As a user, I want the site to have a mobile interface as well as a web interface that both look good. I want a nav that is easy to use and shows the contents of the site without scrolling.

As a marketer, I want users to be able to find the projects/products I am marketing easily.

As a developer, I want sections such as projects to be dynamic so I can easily update them and add to them within the format of the site. I want the sections to have uniform, dry css so that I can make changes effectively.
